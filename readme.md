<!-- a guide on what is going to happen in your game in plain english
how you are planning on building it
a list of features the game will include, in order of importance -->


In spirit of being fortunate enough to attend the Taylor Swift Eras tour this year I had aptly thought of creating a game with taylor swift in mind

This hangman game features words that are typically correlated with Taylor Swift. The styling is also matching one of her featured Albums "Lover"

To play simply click the start to button to retrieve a concealed word about Taylor. To play simply click on the letters that are deemed appropriate. Letters that are included in the word will display. Letters that arent will create a hangman


To add to the humourous aspect of the game in the desktop version, with the addition of mistakes an increasingly distraught Taylor will appear on the hang(woman)

Will you be able to save Taylor from her untimely death?
Play to find out!

In my game you will be able to pick maybe th eleave of difficult and perhaps the topic that the words will include
I am planning on building it by having buttons that once clicked will appear in the position 

There will be a refresh button, buttons for the letters empty divs which will open if the specified letter is there 

I also want to have confetti if someone succeds the hangman game 

//Hangman- TS
Store all words in array
When start is clicked epmty div should be filled with the amount of words in the letter


letters should have event listener 

if letter is included in the empty word it should enter
if not then you will loose a life 
makege git a heart image and then do display none 


need to know sort out what wil happen if letter is included 

and if letter isnt included
