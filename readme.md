<!-- a guide on what is going to happen in your game in plain english
how you are planning on building it
a list of features the game will include, in order of importance -->


In my game you will be able to pick maybe th eleave of difficult and perhaps the topic that the words will include
I am planning on building it by having buttons that once clicked will appear in the position 

There will be a refresh button, buttons for the letters empty divs which will open if the specified letter is there 

I also want to have confetti if someone succeds the hangman game 

//Hangman- TS
Store all words in array
When start is clicked epmty div should be filled with the amount of words in the letter


letters should have event listener 

if letter is included in the empty word it should enter
if not then you will loose a life 
makege git a heart image and then do display none 


need to know sort out what wil happen if letter is included 

and if letter isnt included
